He met with our worldwide team for daily standups and biweekly sprints to continue designing mockups after he finished building from the ones provided.</p> <p> During our chats, he was always thoughtful of the business, user, and the development teamâ€™s pain points, but was never paralyzed in his decision making. He has an eye for UI design along with an inclination to research and understand the user. He is able to discover pain points and begin developing solutions for them, and is always more than happy to communicate when he needs help. </p> <p> Nic is a talented designer and front-end programmer and I am happy to recommend him for any position he might apply. </p>"
